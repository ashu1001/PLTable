# Monte Carlo Simulation of Premier League Table 2019/20

### Introduction

Monte Carlo Simulation is one of the most popular techniques when it comes to simulating all kinds of outcomes and probabilities. These simulations are widely used in sports forecasting, since the multitude of possibilities makes direct calculation of playoff probabilities infeasible.

As part of my final project under Simulation Modelling course, I have tried to accomplish the same thing – A model which can predict Ranking and Points of teams playing in a Football (Soccer) league for this season. Due to Covid-19, the current season has been abandoned or suspended everywhere which provides us with the perfect opportunity to observe what our model predicts has this season been completed.

### About the Data

For the study, the PL Season 2018/19 statistics has been used. The source for the dataset is: http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php
It contains information about all the 380 fixtures with following columns as the main features:
•	Home Team
•	Away Team 
•	FTHG – Goals Scored by the Home Team at Full-time
•	FTAG – Goals Scored by the Away Team at Full-time 

### Procedure & Results
